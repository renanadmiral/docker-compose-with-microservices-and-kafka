Hello!

To run the project, you must open both projects and run the commands -> mvn clean install && docker build -t <-imagename-> .
  
  Then, return to root folder and run -> docker-compose up
  
ps: DON'T FORGET TO RENAME IMAGE NAMES FROM docker-compose.yml FILE, USE THE NAME THAT YOU'VE CHOSEN BEFORE.
